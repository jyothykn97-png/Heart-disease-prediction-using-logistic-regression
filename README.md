# Heart disease prediction using logistic regression

## Description
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, and other health indicators.
Logistic Regression is a supervised classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a binary outcome (heart disease present or not).

## How It Benefits
- Helps in early detection of heart disease
- Assists doctors and healthcare professionals in decision-making
- Reduces risk by identifying high-risk patients
- Cost-effective and fast prediction
- Useful for hospitals, clinics, and health research
- -----

## Working of the Model
- Data Collection<br>
Medical data is collected from a heart disease dataset containing patient health records.
- Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Convert categorical data into numerical format
- Scale numerical features for better performance
- Feature Selection<br>
 Important features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate are selected.
- Model Building<br>
 Logistic Regression model is trained<br>
 the model learns the relationship between input features and heart disease outcome
- Model Training<br>
Data is split into training and testing sets<br>
The model is trained using the training dataset
- Model Evaluation
Accuracy score,
Confusion matrix,
Precision, recall, and F1-score
- prediction<br>
The trained model predicts whether a person has heart disease or not

## What Kind of Output We Are Getting
- Prediction Result:<br>
0 → No Heart Disease<br> 
1 → Heart Disease Present<br> 
-Probability Score (risk level)
- Accuracy of the model
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
---------

Patient Data: [Age=55, BP=140, Cholesterol=240]
Prediction: Heart Disease Present ✅
Probability: 0.82

## Conclusion
The Heart Disease Prediction system using Logistic Regression effectively classifies patients based on their health data.
It demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare by providing fast, reliable, and accurate predictions. With larger datasets and advanced models, prediction accuracy can be further improved.
